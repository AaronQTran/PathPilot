# PathPilot
Opens designated shortcuts to help make starting daily tasks easier and faster. 

**NOTE: When adding in shortcuts, some applications need their file location entered instead of their program name
**for example, if adding in discord, the proper way to add the shortcut would to add 'start "discord file explorer location" instead of 'start discord'

The following UI includes a add shortcut, remove shortcut, and run button followed by a shortcut list and a Exit button on the top left in 'file'

In order to set up path pilot, you must create a batch file, preferably named 'Open_Application_test' 
and connect it to the program by changing the file location. The file path can be found by opening the 
'properties' of the batch file. As seen here:
