# PathPilot
Opens designated shortcuts to help make starting daily tasks easier and faster. 

**NOTE: When adding in shortcuts, some applications need their file location entered instead of their program name
**for example, if adding in discord, the proper way to add the shortcut would to add 'start "discord file explorer location" instead of 'start discord'
